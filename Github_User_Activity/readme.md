# Github User Activity

---

My solution for the [Github User Activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) challenge on [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/).

It is a simple Javascript file that uses the [Github Events API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/events?apiVersion=2022-11-28) to print out a certain user's recent activity.

## Prerequisite

- NodeJs installed on your system

## Installation

**Clone the repository**

```bash
 git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/abdelrahmanMansour1/Backend_Projects

 # Navigate to project dir
 cd Github_User_Activity
```

---

## Example

```bash
#node index.js <username>
node index.js abdelrahmanMansour1
```
